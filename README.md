# Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸŽ®

## Overview

This is a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players and features a clean, responsive interface. Players take turns to mark a 3x3 grid with either "X" or "O", and the first player to align three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players alternate turns to place their marks on the grid.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is optimized for various screen sizes, making it playable on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **Winner Announcement**: The game announces the winner with a congratulatory message.
- **Draw Condition**: The game detects and notifies if the match ends in a draw.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the game at any point to start a new match.
